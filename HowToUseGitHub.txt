HOW TO UPDATE THE CONTENTS OF A REPOSITORY
    Navigate to the folder that contains your project files
    For each added or changed file, enter:
       git add filename.ext            
          (if in sub directory: git add dir/filename.ext)

    If a file has been deleted:
       git rm filename.ext
   
    To actually put them in the repository:
       git commit -m “your notes here”
       git push origin master

    'git status' can be entered after each step to confirm that all is going as
    it should
