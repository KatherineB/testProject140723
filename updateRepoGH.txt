GitHub - How to Update Contents of A Repository

Open the GitHub Shell icon in the Software Development folder on the desktop.

In the command line window, navigate to the folder that contains your project files.

   (You can do a 'git status' after this to see if your changed files are listed.)

git remote add github https://github.com/KatherineB/testProject140723.git
   ('git remote add origin ... ' if repository doesn't yet exist?
      - get the path name from the project page on GitHub if you don't have it)

For each changed file, enter 'git add filename.ext'

   (You can do a 'git status' after adding all the files to see if they are properly listed.)

git commit -m “your notes here”

git push origin master
   ('git push origin github' if repository already exists?)
